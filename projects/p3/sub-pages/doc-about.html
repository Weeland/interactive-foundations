		<h4>Background</h4>
		<p>
			 I am a futuristic man from D0-Earth, which is 500 years from now in your dimension, and I am going to tell you the harsh truth that 500 years from now, the human race will be extinct. And I was the only one left. I have evolved into an immortal quantum creature utilizing a quantum transducer developed by thousands of scientists and allow humans of other times to observe my experience. 
		</p>
		 <p>
			 Time cannot be reversed. Going to different parallel dimensions is my only option; this's how I started searching for other human civilizations. But so far, I never encounter any living human societies, which made me realized if you from 500 hundred years ago don't do something, human extinction is our end. I will continue posting investigations of human extinction and hope that the causes for their demise will be a wake-up call to you.
